# Challenge

This challenge was to apply the following chnages to a webpage:

1. Make a section full height

2. Remove margins and padding.

A link was provided with boilerplate code, which I found confusing as
there wasn't any margins to remove etc., so the only possible solution
was to add the properties to the relevant selectors and elements in the
stylesheet and add a background to show that it was full-height when the
code was run.
